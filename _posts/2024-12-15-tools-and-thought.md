Marshall McLuhan said we shape our tools, and then our tools shape us.

I've been thinking about this in the context of AI development.

## The Shaping

Every tool encodes assumptions:

- **Frameworks** assume certain architectures. Use React, and you think in components. Use Django, and you think in models.

- **Languages** assume certain paradigms. Write Python, and you think in objects. Write Haskell, and you think in functions.

- **IDEs** assume certain workflows. Use VSCode, and you think in files. Use Jupyter, and you think in cells.

These assumptions become invisible. They fade into the background until you can't distinguish tool limitations from problem constraints.

## The Danger

The danger isn't that tools limit us. All tools have limits.

The danger is that we stop seeing the limits. We mistake the boundaries of our tools for the boundaries of the possible.

I've seen teams fail to solve problems because their tools didn't support the solution. Not because the solution was impossible—because the team couldn't imagine beyond their tools.

## The Practice

The antidote is deliberate tool rotation:

**Use different tools.** Not to find the "best" one, but to see each tool's assumptions clearly.

**Build without tools.** Sometimes. Not always. But occasionally go raw to understand what the tools are doing for you.

**Question defaults.** Every default is an opinion. Understand why it's the default. Decide if you agree.

**Watch your thought patterns.** When you reach for a familiar solution, ask: is this the best solution, or is this what my tools make easy?

## Applied to AI

AI tools are particularly assumption-laden:

- **LLM APIs** assume chat interfaces. But not every problem is a conversation.

- **Vector databases** assume embedding similarity. But not every relationship is captured by cosine distance.

- **Agent frameworks** assume tool-calling patterns. But not every task needs tools.

The tools work. They solve problems. But they also constrain how we conceive problems in the first place.

## The Liberation

The most creative AI work I've seen comes from people who treat tools as raw materials, not blueprints.

They use the LLM in ways the API designers didn't intend. They combine tools in unexpected ways. They build new tools when existing ones don't fit.

This requires seeing tools clearly—understanding what they do, what they assume, and what they preclude.

## The Balance

I'm not advocating for tool rejection. Tools are leverage. Good tools make us more capable.

The practice is holding tools lightly. Using them deliberately. Remaining aware that every tool is a lens that clarifies some things and distorts others.

We shape our tools. Then our tools shape us.

The question is: are we shaping ourselves in the direction we want to go?
