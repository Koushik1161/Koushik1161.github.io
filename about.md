I build AI systems — driven by curiosity.

Some projects ship to production. Some stay as prototypes. Some are half-finished experiments abandoned at 2 AM. Some are just ideas I had to see working, even if only once.

That's the process. Follow the curiosity, build the thing, learn what happens.

## Philosophy

The best way to understand AI is to build with it. Not just read about it — actually wire things together, watch them break, figure out why, and try again.

I operate somewhere between research and tinkering. Read the papers. Write the code. Sometimes ship it. Always learn from it.

## Focus

- **Autonomous Agents** — Systems that reason, plan, and execute
- **Multimodal AI** — Combining vision, language, and reasoning
- **Research Experiments** — Testing ideas from papers and my own head
- **Tools & Prototypes** — Quick builds to explore what's possible

## Principles

**Follow curiosity.** The interesting projects find you when you're exploring.

**Ship or learn.** Either it works and you ship it, or it doesn't and you learned something.

**Done is a spectrum.** Some things deserve polish. Some just need to exist.
