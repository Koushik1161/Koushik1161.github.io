I build AI systems that work in the real world.

Not demos. Not prototypes. Production systems that handle complexity, recover from failure, and deliver value at scale.

## Philosophy

The best AI isn't magic—it's engineering. Good engineering means understanding both the theory and the grit of making things work when everything goes wrong.

I operate at the intersection of research and production. Read the papers. Write the code. Ship the system. Learn from what breaks.

## Focus

- **Autonomous Agents** — Systems that reason, plan, and execute
- **Production ML** — Infrastructure that scales and doesn't break at 3 AM
- **Multimodal AI** — Combining vision, language, and reasoning
- **Research to Deployment** — Bridging the gap from paper to product

## Principles

**Ship fast. Learn faster.** Perfect is the enemy of useful.

**Build for failure.** Everything breaks. Design systems that recover.

**Simplify relentlessly.** The best code is the code you don't write.
