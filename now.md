*Updated January 2025*

## Building

Deep in autonomous agent architectures. The gap between "works in demo" and "works in production" is where I live right now. Solving reliability, recovery, and real-world messiness.

## Learning

Reasoning models changed everything. Studying how test-time compute, chain-of-thought, and verification loops create genuine problem-solving capability—not just pattern matching.

## Reading

- Research papers on agent architectures
- Dieter Rams on design principles
- Anything on systems thinking

## Not Doing

- Social media doom-scrolling
- Meetings that should be emails
- Premature optimization
