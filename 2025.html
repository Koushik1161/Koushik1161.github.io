  <h1 class="page__title">My 2025 with ChatGPT</h1>
  <p class="page__subtitle">A year of conversations, code, and collaboration with AI.</p>
</section>

<div class="prose" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-6);">
  <p>I created my OpenAI account on <strong>November 13, 2022</strong> — weeks before ChatGPT even launched on November 30th. I was already exploring GPT-3 and the API when ChatGPT arrived and changed everything. What started as early experimentation evolved into a daily collaboration that fundamentally changed how I build, think, and create.</p>

  <p>Here's my 2025 wrapped — a look back at how AI became my thinking partner.</p>

    <h2>The Numbers</h2>
    <p>This captures my ChatGPT usage throughout 2025 — the conversations, questions asked, code debugged, ideas explored, and problems solved. Each interaction represents a moment where AI augmented my thinking process.</p>

  <div class="prose stats-explanation">
    <h2>The Strategist</h2>
    <p>Based on my conversation patterns, ChatGPT identified my usage archetype as <strong>"The Strategist"</strong>. This reflects how I primarily use AI — not just for quick answers, but for systematic problem-solving, architectural decisions, and long-term planning. I treat ChatGPT as a thinking partner for working through complex technical and strategic challenges.</p>

    <h2>Year in Poem</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT generated this poem based on the themes, topics, and patterns from our conversations throughout the year. It's a creative summary of what I worked on, thought about, and built — distilled into verse. A unique way to reflect on a year's worth of collaboration.</p>

  <p>Four years of building with AI — since late 2021. From curious experimenter to daily collaborator. The tools keep evolving, and so does the way we think alongside them.</p>
